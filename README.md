<h2 align='center'>Hi, Welcome to my Github account. 👨🏻‍💻 </h2>

- 🙋🏻‍♂️ My name is Mahdi and I am currently a Backend developer mainly working with Typescript and Golang.
- 📈 I love to improve my workflow by developing tiny apps in my need (checkout [pam](https://github.com/MahdiAghaei1/pam)).

I am a non-CS student and I studied <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory_scientist'>MLS</a> in university. But my passion and love in Computer Science and programming in general lead me to this direction. I like contributing on Github repos, Learning more about Software engeenering and Getting more confortable with Linux and CLI. Also I enjoy drawing :P
